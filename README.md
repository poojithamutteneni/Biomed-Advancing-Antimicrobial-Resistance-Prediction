# Biomed-Advancing-Antimicrobial-Resistance-Prediction

Antibiotic resistance presents a formidable challenge to global public health, resulting in elevated rates of illness, mortality, and healthcare expenditure.
Existing approaches often overlook contextual relationships(important genomic regions that might contribute to resistance factors) within genomic data, potentially resulting in suboptimal predictions.
To address this limitation, potential solutions included selecting more suitable or multiple reference genomes or incorporating an artificial pseudo-pan-genome.
There is an urgent need for more sophisticated and robust computational frameworks capable of addressing these challenges and providing healthcare professionals with actionable insights to combat antimicrobial resistance effectively.

A hybrid CNN-RNN architecture with attention mechanisms was deemed a more appropriate choice.
This hybrid approach combines the strengths of CNNs in capturing spatial patterns and RNNs with attention mechanisms in modeling temporal dependencies within genomic sequences.
The choice of hybrid architecture was driven by the need to effectively capture both local and global dependencies within genomic sequences, ultimately enhancing prediction performance for antibiotic resistance.
